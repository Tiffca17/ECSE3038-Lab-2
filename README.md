My favourite pokemon would have to be Suicune. The reason is mostly due to a memory I have with it as a child. I was being forced to bed while in the middle of trying to capture it (This was Pokemon Heart Gold btw). I closed the DS (not turned off), as I planned to wake up in the morning and capture it, clearly not remembering that the device could in fact die. However I woke up, with it on basically one percent, and I caught Suicune.

The purpose of this code if for a lab assignment for the ECSE3038 course. The aim is to build post request handlers with FastAPI.

add_person()

  This function will update the data dictionary every time a post request is handled. It accepts requests at the /person route and returns an error message when at least one key has an empty value.
